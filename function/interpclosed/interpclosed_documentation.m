%% |interpclosed| documentation
% The |interpclosed| function creates piecewise polynomial fits of 2D closed 
% curves given by a set of points. The function can be used to (i) return the fit 
% itself; (ii) interpolate values within the curve using an arc-length
% parametrization; or (iii) return the area, perimeter and centroid of the curve.
% |interpclosed| was inspired largely by the functions |cscvn|, |interparc|
% and |arclength|.

%% Description
% |xyq = interpclosed(x,y,tq)| interpolates new data points |xyq| at 
% given positions defined by the array |tq|, along the closed curve defined 
% by the points specified by |x| and |y|. |xyq| is a 2-by-n array containing
% the x-y points corresponding to the query parameter positions defined in
% the n-by-1 array |tq|. The elements of |tq| can only take values between
% $[0,1]$, with 0 being the first point of the curve, 1 the last one and 0.5,
% for example, being in the middle of the length of the curve. The default
% method |'spline'| is used. 
% 
% |[len,area] = interpclosed(x,y)| returns the perimeter |len| and area  
% |area| of the interpolated curve. Both outputs are obviously scalars.
%
% |[len,area,c] = interpclosed(x,y)| returns the perimeter, the area and the
% centroid |c| of the interpolated curve. The centroid is a vector with the
% position as (x,y).
%
% |[len,area,c,I] = interpclosed(x,y)| returns the perimeter, the area, the
% centroid |c|, and second moments of area |I| of the interpolated curve.
% The second moment of area is a vector with three elements: (Ixx, Iyy,
% Ixy).
% 
% |pp = interpclosed(x,y,'pp')| returns the piece-wise polynomial |pp|, which
% is a parametrization of the fit of |x| and |y| in the form $x(t)$ and $y(t)$.
% 
% |[xyq,len,area] = interpclosed(x,y,tq)| returns the new data points and 
% the perimeter and area.
%
% |[xyq,len,area,c] = interpclosed(x,y,tq)| returns the new data points and 
% the perimeter, area, and centroid.
%
% |[xyq,len,area,c,I] = interpclosed(x,y,tq)| returns the new data points  
% and the perimeter, area, centroid and second moments of area.
% 
% |[___] = interpclosed(_,method)| specifies the string |method|: |'linear'|, 
% |'spline'|, or |'pchip'|. The default method is |'spline'|.
% 
% |[___] = interpclosed(_,print)| additionaly prints some figures to show 
% the results. For printing 64 equally arc-length spaced points are used.
%
%% Examples
% *The Interpolated Batman*
%
% This first example only serves as a way to show off the power of the
% function, for more specific application examples, see the ones below.
%
% The so-called Batman function is a somewhat complex piecewise function.
% To construct it, 6 functions have to be defined between certain values of
% $x$ and $y$. You can find more information about the Batman function
% <https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/13131-batman-equation-in-matlab 
% here>
% and
% <https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33124-batman-equation-the-legend
% here>.
% 
% We, on the other hand, will create it as a piecewise polynomial function  
% that delivers very good results, out of a bunch of carefully selected points.
%
% First, we have to define the dataset and plot it to see what it looks like.
% Since the Batman function is symmetric around the y-axis, we just need
% the half of the actual points, then we can flip the arrays and append
% them conveniently. A minimum set of points was selected by choosing only
% the points defining vertices, and, when a curve was necessary, just one
% middle-point.
x = [0 0.5 0.5 0.75 0.75 1 1 2 3 3 7 4 4 3 2 2 1 0];

y = [2.25 2.25 2.25 3 3 1 1 0.863142928 2.717392773 2.717392773 ...
    0 -2.46195542 -2.46195542 -1.32235 -2.365485004 -2.365485004 ...
    -1.59137226 -3];

x = [x, -fliplr(x)]; y = [y,fliplr(y)];

% This doesn't look as terrifying as the dark knight, but we will fix this
% in a bit.
% Please note that some points are given twice, this is done to indicate 
% that the 1st derivative at those points does not have to be continuous.
% This idea was taken from the function |cscvn| and was extended to the 
% pchip fit here. For more information, go
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/cscvn.html
% here>.

% Then fit and plot 300 equally spaced interpolation points, quite awesomely.

% The result is pretty legendary and was only created with 12 distinct points
% and knowledge about the continuity of the derivatives at those points.
% The bat-signal's orientation in 2D space is quite obvious to detect, this
% is down to the fact that its principal axes are easy to find. For
% instance, the signal has symmetry around the y-axis. This makes this
% particular shape useful to show the calculations that produce the
% geometric moments: area, centroid and second moment of area. The task
% will be to identify both a random rotation and translation of the shape.
% Let's make a figure with four subplots and assign an equal number of
% rotation and translations. Then compute the area, centroid, and second
% moment of area. This last piece of information will give us the
% information about the roration.

    % Create the subplot
    subplot(2,2,ii), hold on
    % Show the bat-signal
    fill(xyq(1,:),xyq(2,:),'k'), hold on
    % Create the x- and y-axes before rotation
    xaxis = [-1,1;0,0]*5.25;
    yaxis = [0,0;-1,1]*7;
    % Use the second moments of area to find the rotation
    theta = -atan2(2*(I(3)-area*c(1)*c(2)),...
        ((I(1)-area*c(2)^2)-(I(2)-area*c(1)^2)))/2;
    % Construct the rotation matrix again
    R = [cos(theta) -sin(theta); sin(theta) cos(theta)];
    % Rotate the axes
    xaxis = R*xaxis;
    yaxis = R*yaxis;
    % Plot the axes

% plotted. This can be used to understand what is going on in the function

% continuous derivative ($C^{1}$) and the |'spline'| fit hast two continuous 
% derivatives ($C^{2}$).

% *Interpolation of sets of points describing a polygon*
